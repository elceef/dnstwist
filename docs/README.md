===============================

See what sort of trouble users can get in trying to type your domain name.
Find lookalike domains that adversaries can use to attack you. Can detect
typosquatters, phishing attacks, fraud, and brand impersonation. Useful as an
additional source of targeted threat intelligence.

DNS fuzzing is an automated workflow for discovering potentially malicious
domains targeting your organisation. This tool works by generating a large list
of permutations based on a domain name you provide and then checking if any of
those permutations are in use.
Additionally, it can generate fuzzy hashes of the web pages to see if they are
part of an ongoing phishing attack or brand impersonation, and much more!

$ pip install dnstwist
```

**Git**

If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install it from Git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist.git
$ cd dnstwist
$ pip install .
```

**Debian/Ubuntu/Kali Linux**

Invoke the following command to install the tool with all extra packages:

```
$ sudo apt install dnstwist
```

**Fedora Linux**

```

```

**macOS**

This will install `dnstwist` along with all dependencies, and the binary will
be added to `$PATH`.

```
$ brew install dnstwist
```

**Docker**

Pull and run official image from the Docker Hub:

```
$ docker run -it elceef/dnstwist
```

Alternatively you can build your local images:

```
$ docker build -t dnstwist .
$ docker build -t dnstwist:phash --build-arg phash=1 .
```


Quick start guide
-----------------

The tool will run the provided domain name through its fuzzing algorithms and
generate a list of potential phishing domains along with DNS records.

Usually thousands of domain permutations are generated - especially for longer
input domains. In such cases, it may be practical to display only the ones that
are registered:

```
$ dnstwist --registered domain.name
```

Ensure your DNS server can handle thousands of requests within a short period
of time. Otherwise, you can specify an external DNS or DNS-over-HTTPS server
with `--nameservers` argument.

If domain permutations generated by the fuzzing algorithms are insufficient,
please supply `dnstwist` with a dictionary file. Some dictionary samples with
a list of the most common words used in phishing campaigns are included.

```
$ dnstwist --dictionary dictionaries/english.dict domain.name
```

If you need to check whether domains with different TLD exist, just supply
a dictionary file with the list of TLD.

```
$ dnstwist --tld dictionaries/common_tlds.dict domain.name
```

On the other hand, if only selected algorithms need to be used, `--fuzzers`
argument is available, which takes a comma-separated list.

Note: non-existent algorithm names will be silently ignored.

```
$ dnstwist --fuzzers homoglyph,hyphenation domain.name
```

Apart from the colorful terminal output, the tool allows exporting results to
CSV and JSON:

```
$ dnstwist --format csv domain.name | column -t -s,
$ dnstwist --format json domain.name | jq
```

In case you need just the bare permutations without making any DNS lookups, use
`--format list` argument:

```
$ dnstwist --format list domain.name
```

The tool can perform real-time lookups to return geographical location
(approximated to the country) of IPv4 addresses.

```
$ dnstwist --geoip domain.name
```

The GeoIP2 library is used by default. Country database location has to be
specified with `$GEOLITE2_MMDB` environment variable. If the library or the
database are not present, the tool will fall-back to the older GeoIP Legacy.

To display all available options with brief descriptions simply execute the
tool without any arguments.


Phishing detection
------------------

Manually checking each domain name in terms of serving a phishing site might be
time-consuming. To address this, `dnstwist` makes use of so-called fuzzy hashes
(locality-sensitive hash, LSH) and perceptual hashes (pHash). Fuzzy hashing is
a concept that involves the ability to compare two inputs (HTML code) and
determine a fundamental level of similarity, while perceptual hash is
a fingerprint derived from visual features of an image (web page screenshot).

**Fuzzy hashing**

The unique feature of detecting similar HTML source code can be enabled with
`--lsh` argument. For each generated domain, `dnstwist` will fetch content
from responding HTTP server (following possible redirects), normalize HTML code
and compare its fuzzy hash with the one for the original (initial) domain. The
level of similarity is be expressed as a percentage.

In cases when the effective URL is the same as for the original domain, the
fuzzy hash is not calculated at all in order to reject false positive
indications.

Note: Keep in mind it's rather unlikely to get 100% match, even for MITM attack
frameworks, and that a phishing site can have a completely different HTML
source code.

```
$ dnstwist --lsh domain.name
```

In some cases, phishing sites are served from a specific URL. If you provide a
full or partial URL address as an argument, `dnstwist` will parse it and apply
for each generated domain name variant. Use `--lsh-url` to override URL to
fetch the original web page from.

```
$ dnstwist --lsh https://domain.name/owa/
$ dnstwist --lsh --lsh-url https://different.domain/owa/ domain.name
```

By default, *ssdeep* is used as LSH algorithm, but *TLSH* is also available and
can be enabled like so:

```
$ dnstwist --lsh tlsh domain.name
```

**Perceptual hashing**

If Chromium browser is installed, `dnstwist` can run it in so called headless
mode (without GUI) to render web pages, take their screenshots and calculate
pHash to evaluate visual similarity.

```
$ dnstwist --phash domain.name
```

Additionally, screenshots in PNG format can be saved to selected location:

```
$ dnstwist --phash --screenshots /tmp/domain domain.name
```

Note: Due to the multi-threaded use of a fully functional web browser,
an appropriate amount of free resources (mainly memory) should be provided.


API
---

In case you need to consume the data produced by the tool within your code,
probably the most convenient and fast way is to pass the input as follows.

```
>>> import dnstwist
>>> data = dnstwist.run(domain='domain.name', registered=True, format='null')
```

The arguments for `dnstwist.run()` are translated internally, so the usage is
very similar to the command line. The returned data structure is an
easy-to-process list of dictionaries. Keep in mind that `dnstwist.run()` spawns
a number of daemon threads.


Notes on coverage
-----------------

Along with the length of the domain, the number of variants generated by the
algorithms increases considerably, and therefore the time and resources needed
to verify them. It's mathematically impossible to check all domain
permutations - especially for longer input domains which would require millions
of DNS lookups.
For this reason, this tool generates and checks domains very close to the
original one. Theoretically, these are the most attractive domains from the
attacker's point of view. However, be aware that the imagination of the
aggressors is unlimited.

Unicode tables consist of thousands of characters with many of them visually
similar to each other. However, despite the fact certain characters are
encodable using punycode, most TLD authorities will reject them during domain
registration process. In general, TLD authorities disallow mixing of characters
coming from different Unicode scripts or maintain their own sets of acceptable
characters. With that being said, the homoglyph fuzzer was build on top of
carefully researched range of Unicode characters (homoglyphs) to ensure that
generated domains can be registered in practice.
